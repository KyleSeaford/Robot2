# Robot2 - Raspberry Pi Battle Bot

- [joes word document](https://macclesfieldac-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/personal/185357_macclesfield_ac_uk/Documents/robot%202%20initial%20thoughts.docx?d=w63a2e96dc0ea49afba2ec593eb38b3d0&csf=1&web=1&e=k7cgjb)

## ideas 
Raspberry Pi battle bot type thing. Like the old ones but better, have Joe's help 
- Have a face on the front made from LCD screens that have randomly selected faces and faces that activate when the weapons are in use as well
- Needs underglow
- Flames 

### main boards
#### Raspberry Pi 
- Pros - I can do Python
- Cons - Can be complex to use

Gonna use the Raspberry Pi

## Components
- [x] Raspberry Pi
- [ ] Motors for movement and weapon activation
- [ ] Weapons 
- [ ] Batteries - have some in the garage and old bots
- [ ] Body
- [x] Controller
- [ ] LCD screens for the face
- [ ] Lights

### motors 
- 4 drive motors - yellow motors - [here](https://thepihut.com/products/dc-gearbox-motor-tt-motor-200rpm-3-to-6vdc)
- 2 weapon motors - [here](http://www.kyle-seaford.co.uk/)

### motor board 
- L298N - [here](https://thepihut.com/products/l298n-motor-stepper-driver?variant=31985562550334&currency=GBP&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAuYuvBhApEiwAzq_YiQP_dD8LBw_XjnlppSZOwdWFIbAJQSApgeaOUpGNBAz5ulBfAQGCDhoCdPAQAvD_BwE#product-reviews)

- How to use the board and motors [here](https://ozeki.hu/p_3002-how-to-setup-a-dc-motor-on-raspberry-pi.html)

### controller
- Xbox, PS
- Using Xbox controller

### weapons 
- Weapon 1 - c saw
- Weapon 2 - axe/hammer
- Lighter, big flame, looks cool could burn stuff -- maybe not depending on

### batteries
- 

### lights 
- Just some LEDs, gonna have to boot LEDs to tell when to connect the controller 

### LCD screens 
Might not do, will do in number 2 
- Need to make work maybe buy more [here](https://www.winstar.com.tw/products/character-lcd-display-module/dot-matrix-lcd-module.html)

### dimensions  
- 

## TODO
### to do software 
- [x] Make Pi work
- [x] Get familiar with LEDs 
- [ ] Develop code for movements and weapon activation
- [x] Make controller work 
- [ ] Implement underglow feature
- [ ] Design and create the LCD face -- not doing 
- [ ] Test and iterate on the robot for functionality

### to do hardware 
- [x] Research and decide on specific components
- [ ] choose batteries 
- [ ] choose a motor and control board
- [x] Design bot
- [ ] Joe makes bot
- [ ] Test and iterate on the robot for functionality
