- have a face on the front made from lcd screens that have randomly selected faces and faces that actervate when the weppons are in use aswell
- needs underglow

### main boards
#### arduino
- pros - used in old ones, have the code already
- cons - not use to code, need to learn c

#### raspberry pi 
- pros - i can do python
- cons - can be complex to use

gonna use the raspberry pi

## Components

### moters 
- joes job, need to find them 

### lights 
- just some leds 

## to do 
- [ ] Make pi work 
- [ ] Research and decide on specific components
- [ ] Desgin bot
- [ ] Develop code for movements and weapon activation
- [ ] Joe makes bot 
- [ ] Design and create the LCD face
- [ ] Implement underglow feature
- [ ] Test and iterate on the robot for functionality
- [ ] Consider adding additional features for customization
- [ ] Have Fun
