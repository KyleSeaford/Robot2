# Robot2 - Raspberry Pi Battle Bot

## ideas 
arduino or rasbury pi battle bot type thing. like the old ones but better, have joes help 
- have a face on the front made from lcd screens that have randomly selected faces and faces that actervate when the weppons are in use aswell
- needs underglow

### main boards
#### arduino
- pros - used in old ones, have the code already
- cons - not use to code, need to learn c

#### raspberry pi 
- pros - i can do python
- cons - can be complex to use

gonna use the raspberry pi

## Components
- [x] Raspberry Pi
- [x] LCD screens for the face
- [ ] Motors for movement and weapon activation
- [ ] Underglow lights
- [ ] batteries - have some in the garage and old bots
- [ ] Body 

### moters 
- 4 drive moters - maybe
- 2 wepon moters - maybe

### lcd screens 
- got a blue 16x2 and a green 16x2 might get more

### moters 
- joes job, need to find them 

### lights 
- just some leds 

## to do main 
- [ ] Research and decide on specific components
- [ ] Desgin bot
- [ ] Consider adding additional features for customization
- [ ] Have Fun

## to do software 
- [ ] Make pi work 
- [ ] Develop code for movements and weapon activation
- [ ] Design and create the LCD face
- [ ] TEST IT WORKS 
- [ ] Implement underglow feature
- [ ] Test and iterate on the robot for functionality

## to do hardware 
- [ ] Research and decide on specific components
- [ ] Desgin bot
- [ ] chose battries 
- [ ] chose moter and controle board 
- [ ] Joe makes bot
- [ ] Test and iterate on the robot for functionality
