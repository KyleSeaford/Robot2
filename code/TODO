    one board, left right motors, 4 in total 2 each side 

    second board, blade and hammer, blade just spins, hammer need to ask joe about it 

    if hammer is special motor find out how to do if it's a normal one add max and min switches to the motors movement


MCB = motor control board

each board gets 4 wires to pi:
3 GPIO wires to first 3 pins next to the power blue bit 

1 power
    the power goes from pi and to the middle pin on MCB and the battery 

    other side of the battery goes to the +12v on MCB

need to do the same with the LEDs basically, gonna be done with triggers for now left trigger for left side right trigger for right side 

will also have another script so that you can use the left joycon to control the motors
